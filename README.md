# MPPD (Mesh Phantom Posture Deformer)
The GUI-based program to deform the posutre of the mesh-type phantom (for both tetrahedral/polygonal phantom).
The program was tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and McBook M1/M2, but is expected to work in other operating systems with appropriate settings.

## Program usage
For the program execution, phantom data first should be prepared.
The required phantom data files are OBJ and TGF files. For the deformation of the tetrahedral mesh, files for the original mesh (ELE, NODE) are also required.

## Request for access to the code
Please apply for the access to the code and/or compatible mesh phantoms on the mesh-phantom website (https://mesh-phantom.com).
